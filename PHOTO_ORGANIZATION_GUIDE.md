## 📝 Step-by-Step Upload Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Photos Locally

1. **Organize your photos** into the appropriate category folders
2. **Rename your photos** with descriptive names (no spaces, use hyphens)
3. **Recommended formats**: JPG, PNG
4. **Recommended size**: Under 2MB each for faster loading

### Step 2: Add Photos to HTML

For each photo you add, you'll need to create an entry in `index.html`. Here are templates for each category:

#### 🏔️ Landscape Template
```html
<div class="photo-item" data-category="landscape" data-upload-date="2024-01-15T10:30:00">
    <img src="photos/landscape/your-photo-name.jpg" alt="Your Photo Description" loading="lazy">
    <div class="photo-overlay">
        <h3>Your Photo Title</h3>
        <p>Landscape</p>
        <p class="upload-date">Uploaded: Jan 15, 2024</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 👤 Portrait Template
```html
<div class="photo-item" data-category="portrait" data-upload-date="2024-01-16T14:20:00">
    <img src="photos/portrait/your-photo-name.jpg" alt="Your Photo Description" loading="lazy">
    <div class="photo-overlay">
        <h3>Your Photo Title</h3>
        <p>Portrait</p>
        <p class="upload-date">Uploaded: Jan 16, 2024</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 🌿 Nature Template
```html
<div class="photo-item" data-category="nature" data-upload-date="2024-01-17T09:45:00">
    <img src="photos/nature/your-photo-name.jpg" alt="Your Photo Description" loading="lazy">
    <div class="photo-overlay">
        <h3>Your Photo Title</h3>
        <p>Nature</p>
        <p class="upload-date">Uploaded: Jan 17, 2024</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 🏙️ Urban Template
```html
<div class="photo-item" data-category="urban" data-upload-date="2024-01-18T16:30:00">
    <img src="photos/urban/your-photo-name.jpg" alt="Your Photo Description" loading="lazy">
    <div class="photo-overlay">
        <h3>Your Photo Title</h3>
        <p>Urban</p>
        <p class="upload-date">Uploaded: Jan 18, 2024</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Step 3: Replace Sample Photos

In your `index.html`, find the photo grid section and replace the Unsplash URLs with your local photos:

**Before (Unsplash):**
```html
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=500&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Mountain Landscape" loading="lazy">
```

**After (Your Photo):**
```html
<img src="photos/landscape/mountain-sunset.jpg" alt="Mountain Sunset" loading="lazy">
```
